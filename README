# Radar Simulation Project

This project simulates a simple radar system using Python. It calculates the distance of a target based on the time taken for a signal to return after reflection.

## Features
- Transmits and receives radar signals.
- Visualizes transmitted and reflected signals.
- Calculates target distance using the speed of light and round-trip time.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
Run the following command in your terminal:
```bash
python radar_simulation.py
